Whether destined for another surface finishing process or going for dispatch, all fabrications and components should be thoroughly cleaned after manufacture.

Sometimes it is necessary to clean assemblies in between manufacturing steps to ensure contamination is not an issue. This can often be a problem when leading onto heat treatment or welding operations, as surface contaminants are easily absorbed into the upper surface layers and extremely difficult to remove. The subsequent masking effect which can occur and insufficient cleaning can both impair the overall appearance as well and reducing its performance.
