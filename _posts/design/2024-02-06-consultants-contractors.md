### The Fundamentals of Site Work
<hr>
The key aspects and fundamentals to site works and services lies in the preparation ,organization, documentation and communication from start to finish, ensuring that all levels of the work force and site representation understand both the requirements and the methods in which the controlled procedures are to be carried out.

### The Preparation
<hr>
Crucial if any project is to be deemed a success is methodical preparation and planning. That’s why in all instances the first step of any potential contract is for an Anokap principal consultant to visit the site and make a full appraisal of every aspect, condition and possibility, before returning and drafting a detailed, informative proposal based on first hand knowledge.

### Goals & Objectives

This combination makes our operation both lean and efficient in areas which set us apart from others, providing the requirements of each individual project to the full specification, on time and within budget.

### Certification
<hr>
The initial proposal, procedures, work instructions and methods statements detailed and continuously refer to check points, monitoring operations, milestones and signoff’s which are second nature to the key appointed officers in charge and their leading hands. In a legible formulated format and depending on the complexity of the project, control documentation is recorded, completed and passed off by seniors at every stage which comes to form the core of the handover certificates of compliance on completion. Copies of these records are maintained in the archives for a minimum of 2 years and electronic softcopies held indefinitely.

### The Future
<hr>
Many years ago, it was demonstrated by Airlines that clean surfaces are efficient and reduce operating cost, this can be said for almost any industrial sector. Following works of either consultation or full turn-key management cleaning packages, at the clients request, Anokap Solutions will go that step further in service to investigate how to optimise the full potential of the surface topography to it’s specific application.
